# Linear System Solver

You can input any linear system of any NxN size, where N is => 2, to be solved.

## Installation

Download the CPP file and run it within your own compiler, or download "LinearSystemSolver.exe" from the releases and run it if on Windows system.

## Usage

Here is an example of a 3x3 linear system that can be solved through the use of the program.

When first executed, you will be asked the size of the linear system. In this case it is 3, so input 3 and press enter.

Enter the values of the system, excluding the solution - this is not space or newline sensitive, so use whatever you prefer..
